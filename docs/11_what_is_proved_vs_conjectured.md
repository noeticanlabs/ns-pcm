# 11 — What is proved vs conjectured

**Proved/Derived (within this program):**
- Regularized direction field \(\xi_\varepsilon\) avoids singularities.
- Saturated functional \(\mathcal S_\varepsilon\) has matched weights.
- Viscous evolution produces dissipation plus explicit residue \(J_\varepsilon\).
- Region split \(A/B\) controls stretching on \(B\) and \(A_1\).
- The only remaining term is \(\mathcal R_\varepsilon(\delta)=\int_{|\omega|<\delta}\|S\|_{op}\).

**Not proved (explicit conjecture / hypothesis):**
- A quantitative bound on sublevel sets \(|E_\delta|\) sufficient to force \(\mathcal R_\varepsilon\to 0\) as \(\delta\to 0\).
- Equivalently, a uniform bound of \(\mathcal R_\varepsilon\) by dissipation.

This boundary is enforced again in `docs/14_claims_contract.md`.
