# 10 — Region A_2 residue (aligned + tiny |ω|)

The remaining residue is localized:
\[
\mathcal R_\varepsilon(\delta)
:= \int_{|\omega|<\delta} \|S\|_{op}\,dx.
\]

This is the only non-absorbed term after the A/B split.

Bounding \(\mathcal R_\varepsilon\) reduces to quantitative control on the sublevel set
\(E_\delta=\{|\omega|<\delta\}\) and how large strain can be there.

This is where the **Sublevel Set Lemma (SSL)** enters.
