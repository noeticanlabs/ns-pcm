# 03 — Saturated polarization functional

Define the **saturated polarization functional**:
\[
\mathcal S_\varepsilon(t) := \int |\omega|^2\,\Psi(G_\varepsilon)\,dx,
\qquad \Psi(G) := \frac{G}{1+G}.
\]

This choice is *structurally matched*:
- \(\Psi\) is bounded in \([0,1)\),
- \(\Psi'(G)=1/(1+G)^2\) has built-in damping,
- identities like \(\frac{\sqrt G}{1+G}\le 1/2\) hold uniformly.

This eliminates the weight mismatch that ruins log-weight entropies.
