# 07 — Region split: A/B decomposition in directional complexity

Split domain by directional complexity:
- Region A (aligned): \(G\le M\)
- Region B (complex): \(G>M\)

This is tactical:
- On **B**, the saturated weight is ~1 and angular dissipation is strong.
- On **A**, \(|\nabla\xi|\le \sqrt M\) gives local Lipschitz alignment, enabling Constantin–Fefferman depletion.

The stretching term (weighted or unweighted) is controlled on B and on A_1,
but a residue persists on A_2 where \(|\omega|\) is small.
