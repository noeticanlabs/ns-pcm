# Lemma: Residue identification after A/B split (schematic)

After splitting by directional complexity \(G\le M\) vs \(G>M\),
all terms in the NS-PCM inequality chain are absorbable into dissipation
*except* a sublevel-set localized strain residue:

\[
\mathcal R(\delta) = \int_{|\omega|<\delta}\|S\|_{op}\,dx.
\]

Thus, closing the chain reduces to controlling \(\mathcal R(\delta)\) as \(\delta\to 0\),
either by measure decay of \(\{|\omega|<\delta\}\) or by a stronger structural property.
