# Lemma: Saturated functional basic bounds

Let \(G\ge 0\) and \(\Psi(G)=\frac{G}{1+G}\).

Then:
1. \(0\le \Psi(G) < 1\)
2. \(\Psi'(G)=\frac{1}{(1+G)^2}\)
3. Uniform inequalities:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{G}}{1+G} \le \frac12,\qquad
   \frac{G}{(1+G)^2} \le \frac14.
   \]
These are used to bound commutator factors without \(\varepsilon\)-dependence.
